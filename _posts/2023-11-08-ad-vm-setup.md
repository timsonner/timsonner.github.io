# Active Directory VM Setup with VirtualBox  
First thing is download a version of Windows Server...  
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2022  

You should also have VirtualBox installed...  
https://www.virtualbox.org/  

## Spin up the VM and install Windows Server... 
For this guide we're using **Windows Server 2022 Standard Evaluation (Desktop Experience)** x64  
Custom Install - Utilizing entire disk space  
**Do you want to allow your PC to be discoverable by other PCs and devices on this network?** - No  
Decent idea to install VirtualBox Guest Additions    

### Take a VM Snapshot of the machine before first login with built-in **Administrator** account  
Power down the Virtual Machine using PowerShell. Power on the VM once VirtualBox Network Settings are made      
```  
shutdown /s /t 0
```  
 
# VirtualBox Network Setup  

File > Tools > Network Manager  
Create a host-only network     

![](/assets/images/ad-vm-setup/ad-vm-setup-vbox-network.png)  

Pick a network or use 192.168.56.1 which is default VirtualBox network address.  

## Setup a Host-Only network  
Select the machine and then **Settings**  
Choose the **Adapter 2** tab, check the box **Enable Network Adapter**  
Select the dropdown **Attached to:**, select **Host-only-Adapter**  

Adapter 1 should be NAT in order to let the Windows Server communicate to the outside world using the Host OS (real life) adapter. If you're running in a sandbox, disable Adapter 1.

# Windows Networking Setup  
### Fire up the VM... 

PowerShell...  
```  
ncpa.cpl
```  
![](/assets/images/ad-vm-setup/ad-vm-setup-win-network.png)  

## Edit the IPv4 Network Settings  
![](/assets/images/ad-vm-setup/ad-vm-setup-win-network-2.png) 

Toggle the **Use the following IP address:** radio button  

### Settings breakdown  
Ip address: Sets the IP address of our server. I'm using the 192.168.56 subnet from our VirtualBox netw0rk and assigning the server to the 105 slot.  

Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0, another way of saying CIDR /24.  

Default gateway: 192.168.56.1 is the default gateway for the 192.168.56.1 network.  

Preferred DNS server: 127.0.0.1, we set this so the server (localhost) acts as its own Domain Name Server, we'll setup DNS in a bit...  

Try pinging the Windows guest at 192.168.56.105 from the host OS. It should fail, we need to poke holes in the firewall...

# Windows Firewall Settings  

P0werShell...    
```  
wf.msc
```  

![](/assets/images/ad-vm-setup/ad-win-vm-setup-win-firewall.png)  

Find and click the **Windows Defender Firewall Properties** link  
Click the **Customize...** button next to **Protected network connections:** in the dialog
Uncheck **Ethernet 2**, this allows Network Traffic to and from the host running VirtualBox. These **Ethernet** and **Ethernet 2** adapters are a referene to the VirtualBox N3twork Adapters we created earlier. **Ethernet** is our NAT adapter, **Ethernet 2** is our **Host-only Adapter**      
Repeat this process for the remaining **Private Profile** and **Public Profile** tabs  

Try pinging the Windows Server VM (192.168.56.105) from the host OS now...  

# Install Active Directory  
Powershell - If Server Manager isn't already running...  
```  
servermanager
```  

### Add a Server Role  

Select Manage > Add Roles and Features  
Select **Role-based or feature-based installation**  
Select the Windows Host as the Server (same as Windows hostname)  
Check the **Active Directory Domain Services** check box  
![](/assets/images/ad-vm-setup/ad-win-vm-setup-add-role.png)
Click **Add Features** button  
### Once Role is installed, promote the Server to a Domain Controller  

![](/assets/images/ad-vm-setup/ad-vm-setup-win-promote-dc.png)  

Toggle the **Add a new forest** radio button  
![](/assets/images/ad-vm-setup/ad-vm-win-setup-add-forest.png)

Ignore the warning about DNS delegation  
Use default paths  

### Machine will reboot and apply settings...  
The machine is now part of the domain...  

# Finish setting up DNS  
In Server Manager, navigate to **Tools > DNS**  

Expand the Server tree and Select **Reverse Lookup Zones**  

Right click on **Reverse Lookup Zones** and select **New Zone**  

Zone Type: Default Setting (Primary zone)  
Store the zone in Active Directory: True  

> If you've installed DNS before Active Directory Services, the **Store the zone in Active Directory** checkbox is how you fix your Reverse DNS lookups... Happened to me, idk...

Replication Scope: All DNS servers running on domain controllers in this domain: timsonner.com

Reverse Lookup Zone Name - Network ID: 192.168.56  

### Create a new Reverse DNS Pointer  
In DNS Manager, right click the new Reverse Lookup Zone **56.168.192.in-addr.arpa**, select **New Pointer (PTR)...**  

Fill in the hostname with that of the Windows Server  

Powershell  
```  
hostname
```

# Test out the DNS settings...  
![](/assets/images/ad-vm-setup/ad-vm-win-dns-test.png)

Edit **/etc/resolv.conf** adding the following line to the top of the file  

```  
nameserver 192.168.56.105
```  

![](/assets/images/ad-vm-setup/ad-vm-setup-linux-nslookup.png)  

# Join Kali to the domain  
```  
realm join -v -U Administrator timsonner.com
```  
![](/assets/images/ad-vm-setup/ad-vm-setup-linux-realm-join.png)  

### Kali was successfully domain joined...
